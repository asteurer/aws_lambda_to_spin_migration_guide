## Usage

### Creating the terraform.tfvars file:

### Building the application:


# Spin

## Requirements

- Latest version of Spin: https://developer.fermyon.com/spin/v2/install
- Spin's `py2wasm` plugin installed:
    - After Spin is installed, run `spin plugin install py2wasm -y` in the terminal.
- Python 3.12
- Python's `virtualenv` library installed: 
    - After Python is installed, run `pip install virtualenv` in the terminal.


## Usage

This example will show how to interact with S3. See https://docs.aws.amazon.com for API information for other AWS services.

### Creating the .env file:

In the same directory as the code files, create a `.env` file with the below variables: 

```dotenv
SPIN_VARIABLE_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=access-key-id
SPIN_VARIABLE_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=secret-access-key
# Keep in mind, if your AWS account doesn't require MFA to access its resources, you may not need a session token. 
SPIN_VARIABLE_AWS_SESSION_TOKEN=session-token
# Example region
SPIN_VARIABLE_AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=us-west-2
# Example service
SPIN_VARIABLE_AWS_SERVICE=s3
# Note the port number at the end of the host
SPIN_VARIABLE_AWS_HOST=your-bucket-name.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com:80
```

Notice that the environment variables are formatted `SPIN_VARIABLE_UPPERCASE_VARIABLE_NAME`. This is the format required by Spin to read environment variables properly. As can be seen in the `spin.toml` file, the Spin application accesses the variables as `lowercase_variable_name`. 


### Building and running the application:

Once the .env is created, export the environment variables, build a virtual environment, install the dependencies, and then run the Spin application. 

Example commands for Debian Linux:

```bash
# Exporting the variables
set -a
source .env
set +a

# Creating and activating a virtual environment
python -m virtualenv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# Installing dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Building and running the Spin application
spin up --build

# Exit virtual environment
deactivate
```


### Interacting with the application:

While the Spin app is running, open a new terminal window and try running the commands below:

#### List bucket objects:

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:3000
```

#### Get bucket object:

```bash
curl -o file_name.extension -H 'uri-path: s3/file/path' http://127.0.0.1:3000
```

#### Delete bucket object:

```bash
curl --request DELETE -H 'uri-path: s3/file/path' http://127.0.0.1:3000
```

#### Place object into bucket:

```bash
curl --request PUT -H 'uri-path: s3/file/path' --data-binary @/path/to/file http://127.0.0.1:3000
```
